                            <p>"During my second year as a BBA Hons HR student, 
                                I attended Ms. Neha Chaturvedi's impactful training on 
                                communication and personality development. Her sessions 
                                covered essential skills like confidence-building, public 
                                speaking, grooming, and non-verbal communication, while also 
                                offering practical tools such as LinkedIn, resume writing, 
                                and email etiquette. Neha ma’am’s engaging and approachable 
                                style made learning enjoyable, boosting my confidence, especially 
                                in speaking. Her guidance played a crucial role in securing a 
                                job at a multinational company before I graduated. I highly recommend 
                                her training for meaningful, results-driven learning.."</p>

                                your guidance, I’ve been able to build a much stronger presence on the platform 
                                and feel confident in navigating LinkedIn for professional growth. Your passion

                                  of BSc IT, looking back, I’m a completely different person from who I was in 
                                  my first year. My dressing and walking sense also required improvement, and Ms. 
                                  Neha Chaturvedi Ma'am helped me transform my overall personality. She taught me 
                                  how to present myself professionally and refine my communication. Thanks to her

                                my BCA course and the experience has been truly transformative. 
                                Her ability to break down complex concepts of communication, 
                                teamwork, and leadership into practical lessons made a huge impact
                                on my personal and professional growth. She creates a learning 
                                environment that is both engaging and supportive, encouraging us 
                                to step out of our comfort zones."</p>

                                including the school CRM sale. Her engaging sessions reflected a deep
                                understanding of the tasks at hand, and her insights were key to our 
                                success. Beyond her professional expertise, Neha Madam's support and 
                                encouragement fostered a positive environment where I felt confident 
                                sharing ideas and seeking advice. Her mentorship has greatly 
                                contributed to my professional growth. I wish her all the best,
